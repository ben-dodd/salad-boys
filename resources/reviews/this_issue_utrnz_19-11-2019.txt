Ōtautahi garage rockers Salad Boys have re-emerged with a delightfully fuzzy double single released on Southbound and Canterbury imprint Melted Ice Cream. Fronted by prolific guitar guru Joe Sampson (T54), new tunes ‘The Issue’ and B-Side ‘Onwards and Downwards' feel clean and confident despite the progression to a noisier, lo-fi vibe since dropping their killer sophomore album This Is Glue in 2018. Although Sampson is the brain behind the vocals, guitar, bass and mixing, Christchurch local legend Brian Feary (Wurld Series, The Dance Asthmatics) hopped aboard for drums and sound engineering at Dog's Hit Factory studio. An appropriately warped Ben Dodd directed clip for 'The Issue' coincides with the release, filmed with full band who are barely perceivable as they perform in what looks like an oil slick in a petri dish.
