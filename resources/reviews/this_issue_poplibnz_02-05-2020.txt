Our song for Day 2 of New Zealand Music Month 2020 is “This Issue” from Christchurch band Salad Boys.

Salad Boys, in the case of this intriguing single, are guitar virtuoso Joe Sampson (guitars, bass and vocals) and the ubiquitous and omnipresent Brian Feary (drums).

Salad Boys have previously inclined more towards the jangle-pop and fuzzy garage rock end of the guitar music spectrum. So it was a surprise to find “This Issue” (and the other song here “Onwards and Downwards”) veering in spectacular fashion towards the very best parts of post-punk’s New Wave.

The guitar parts here, song arrangement, and kind of anti-funk groove reminds me of Magazine. Sampson is a similar kind of guitar alchemist as John McGeoch (Magazine, Siouxsie and the Banshees, PIL), finding textures and sounds that add relish to his ability as a player and songwriter, and giving the song its interesting sonic character.

I love this song. Had this song been recorded and released by Magazine in the 1980s it would have been a Hit Single, mimed badly by the band on Top of The Pops. But it was recorded and released in 2019 by Salad Boys from Christchurch New Zealand so there’s a cool DIY video of them miming it fairly convincingly in their rehearsal room instead.
