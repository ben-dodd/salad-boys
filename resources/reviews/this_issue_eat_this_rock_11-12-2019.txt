Salad Boys return with their new single This Issue . Here we have a garage rock track where the most important role have the guitars, which produce a highly addictive and noisy riff. The vocals, in contrast with all this noise, are melodic and velvety.

Salad Boys are an indie rock band from Christchurch, New Zealand. They have previously released two albums, Metalmania in 2015 and This Is Glue in 2018.

They already have some amazing performance credits to their name including a tour of the US in 2015 where they performed a set live to air on KEXP in Seattle and at Jack White's Third Man Records in Nashville. They supported Brian Jones Town Massacre in their home town of Christchurch NZ in late 2015 and also supported Parquet Courts on their run of shows throughout NZ in 2015.

Salad Boys are currently touring Australia.
