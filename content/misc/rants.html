  <h3>On the State of Live Music</h3>
  <p>It's been interesting watching how the live music scene has evolved over the years. Back when we started, you could play a show at a small venue and actually connect with people. These days, everyone's got their phones out recording everything. We're not complaining - it's just different.</p>
  <p>The best shows are still the ones where everyone puts their phones away and just experiences the moment. Those are magical.</p>

  <h3>Why Vinyl Still Matters</h3>
  <p>We get asked sometimes why we still release on vinyl in the age of streaming. The answer is simple: there's something special about holding a physical record, looking at the artwork, reading the liner notes while the music plays.</p>
  <p>Streaming is convenient, sure. But vinyl is an experience. It forces you to sit down and actually listen to an album from start to finish. That's how we intended these songs to be heard.</p>
