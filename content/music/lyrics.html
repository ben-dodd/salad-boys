Verse 1:
Walking down the street today
Everything seems far away
The lights are dim, the sound is low
I don't know which way to go

Chorus:
Psuedo, psuedo
Nothing's ever what it seems
Psuedo, psuedo
Living in between the dreams

Verse 2:
The world keeps spinning round and round
My feet can't seem to touch the ground
I reach out but there's nothing there
Just empty space and vacant stare

(Chorus)

Bridge:
Is this real or is this fake?
How much more can I take?
The lines are blurred, the truth is bent
I don't know what any of it meant

(Chorus x2)
      </div>

Verse 1:
Met you in a dream last night
Everything was feeling right
We walked along the moonlit shore
I never felt this way before

Chorus:
Dream date, can't escape
This feeling that I have for you
Dream date, wide awake
Wondering if you feel it too

Verse 2:
Woke up and you disappeared
Just like I always feared
The sun came up, reality
Took you away from me

(Chorus)

Bridge:
Close my eyes and try again
Maybe I'll see you then
In that world where we can be
Together for eternity

(Chorus x2)
